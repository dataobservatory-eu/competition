The name of the company is Reprex, this

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,580
is a data science expression. It means

4
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:13,559
reproducible example: we help to create

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:15,240
the automation of small data tasks that

6
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,340
small organizations don't have a staff for.

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,320
So if you can do this once, you can

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,060
do it second time, third time, fourth time...

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,060
So that is what reprex means and that is what

10
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,039
we do. We work with the data inequalities.

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,039
We think that big data creates

12
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:32,520
inequalities because small NGOs that want to

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:35,340
fight climate change or greenwashing or

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,399
those music organizations that want to

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,200
give womxn an equal voice in music do

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,000
not really have a good access to data.

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,219
I've been working with the music

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,219
industry for 10 years in 12 countries

19
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,620
and I always saw that if you have a

20
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,300
small music label and you want to make

21
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,760
sure that your data is available for

22
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,340
YouTube or Spotify so that your artists get

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,800
paid you have to fill in a lot of data.

24
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,379
You don't have a data team for this we

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,420
want to prepare this for you in a way. 

26
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,640
Then make it reproducible again and

27
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,260
again and again.

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,780
"Doing good and doing business" speaks to

29
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,659
me because I always wanted to do a

30
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,400
company that is not only about profit. 

31
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,860
We know a lot about what's going wrong with

32
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,960
the ecosystems of the Earth, but how we

33
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,580
change how people act is more

34
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,040
interesting. So I would like to build a

35
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,200
company that helps in these things.

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,439
The Hague is already the Smartest City

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,439
it won last year this award.  The Hague is

38
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,939
an ideal location for us because it

39
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,320
is a center of international

40
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:36,420
organizations and knowledge

41
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,280
organizations like the Europeana, the

42
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,280
Koninklijke bibliotheek, and then of course

43
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,439
the Royal Conservatory and the PAARD.

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,680
If you vote for us, you also vote for the Hague,

45
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,900
because we want to bring here large data

46
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,240
collaborations from the world and that

47
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,720
will help the Hague remain the Smartest 

48
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,720
City in the world.
