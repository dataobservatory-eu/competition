The transition towards a sustainable and inclusive economy depends on collaboration. That is why we are bringing together startups, scale-ups, investors, policymakers, and other impact makers from around the world in The Hague for the 7th edition of ImpactFest.

With the [The Hague Innovators Challenge](https://www.impactcity.nl/en/service/the-hague-innovators-challenge/), the municipality of The Hague challenges startups, scale-ups, and students to present their innovative ideas for global issues, as described in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The nominees receive a substantive program aimed at further development and the growth of the plan or organization. At the end of the substantive program, all nominees submit a definitive action plan and this is pitched to a professional jury. The jury chooses one winner per category.
