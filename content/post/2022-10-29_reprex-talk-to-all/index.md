The message is the message! We are an ethical data and AI company, and one of our topics is detecing if algorithms are biased towards the English language speakers. We want to teach the computer to understand small languages, and of course, everyone, who is under-represented in data: womxn, former colonial nations.

We are finalists in The Hague Innovation Awards with a product offering and a message that big data and AI should work for all: ethnic minorities, small nations, small languages, womxn.  We are measuring why certain artists are not getting recommended and paid on global streaming platforms, or why NGOs do not find the right data about fighting greenwashing.  We want to help small businesses, civil society organizations, and NGOs who cannot hire a data engineer and a data scientist to fight data monopolies. Who cannot defend themselves from the dark patterns of greedy algorithms?

We want to win the audience prize, and we will collect, like our respectable competitors online votes between 1-14 November 2022.  We would like to ask your help to talk to all groups of the Hague and South Holland, and anywhere in the world where our message resonates well.

We are speaking in non-native English to a Dutch language jury, but we want to talk to many small businesses, artists, womxn, and minorities in their own language.  Therefore we would like to ask you to translate your message into your own language.   We only need a few lines that we can add to our campaign video which you can see here (still without the captions here.)
