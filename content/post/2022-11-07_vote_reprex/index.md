## What do we do in the music industry and in the music cultural sector?


- [x] Our data coverage already includes some of the least developed countries. 
- [x] The Digital Music Observatory already has more than 16 institutional users, and more than 20 external curators. 
- [x] With the help of a  significant 3-million-euro grant to develop this into a permanent European Music Observatory vying for official recognition of the EU.
- [x] Has a track record to solve complex problems, e.g., valuing and pricing music, providing evidence on piracy (contributing to SDG 8—improving decent working conditions for precarious creative workers), predicting audiences, and finding algorithmic biases against small-country artists and womxn (SDG 4, 5 - AI, metadata, data problems in music education and bias against womxn)
- [x] In a partnership with the Hague and the Dutch music institutions in our city, we could bring about 20 jobs to the town and make it one of the most important knowledge hubs on music worldwide


## Product 

1. Our `data observatories` (platform products) cover our R&D and platform costs while giving us access to an expanding range of prime clients. We use 21-st century open-source data engineering solutions, a decentralized data governance method, and web 3.0 technologies to avoid conflicts of interest and prevent the data Sisyphus of error-prone human data wrangling.  There is little competition on this service level (there are about 60 UN/EU/OECD recognized data observatories, and almost all of them are managed by a different operator.)  This layer is already monetized, and we have proven success. Our unique advantage is a combination of legal and technological skills: understanding legally open data, web 3.0, and data modeling, and the ability to participate in the open-source statistical /scientific software creator community.


2. We create `open-source software applications` that fuel our data observatories with unprocessed, open, linked data. We create software for the R statistical environment, which is used in both official statistics and in many business and academic organizations. The production of R software components is a competitive field, but we believe that our position is strong: the vast majority of R packages are lightly or not at all serviced because of the lack of financing.

3. We provide `bespoke analytics solutions` to our institutional partners in our data observatories. Such bespoke solutions iterate over our existing software components, helping us design better applications within an ever-expanding ecosystem. Providing tailored data-science services would require a large organization without a clear focus. We provide these services on an ad-hoc basis only among institutional partners and users of our data observatories. In these circles, which are often prime clients, we face little or no competition because we are trusted partners and data and solution providers. This is a key to our revenue and market growth.

4. We develop high-value `software-as-service applications` that leverage our data observatory assets and our software solution into a novel, commercially valuable uses. Our applications are built around our family of open-source software and generalize our bespoke analytics solutions. We are in a late prototype phase where we already have some revenue and are trying to prepare for scaling up at the correct price with three of our applications. All of our applications are entering into highly competitive market segments. We are building on our ‘unfair’ advantage that we are bundling our solutions with data that is not accessible to competitors, and we can test them in the protected ecosystems of our observatories.


## Plans in The Hague?

Our message is simple: `doing business and doing good` for the city of the Hague means a vote for Reprex.   We would like to win the `Hague Innovators Challenge` in 2022 because we believe we could multiply our growth in partnership with the Hague. We have a significant budget to develop our observatories, and our company is already located in the Hague, in [Apollo 14](https://www.apollo14.nl/en/)—but most of our team members, not to mention the observatory’s non-data personnel are not based in our beautiful and smart city. The observatories are important platforms for our growth, and they could create a lot more jobs and impact in the city than in our startup company.  Should we win the prize, we would spend the 25,000 euros on one thing: to develop our observatories into a real public-private partnership in the Hague, with a permanent office in [Apollo 14](https://www.apollo14.nl/en/) or the [Hague Humanity Hub](https://www.humanityhub.net/). 

Reprex’s data observatories, particularly the [Green Deal Data Observatory](/#slider) are public-private partnerships that foster the collective collection, processing, peer-review, and reuse of novel big data, like BeeSage’s beehive data, and reusable statistical and environmental data. We hope to place the permanent institution of this PPP in the Hague, which is already the [World's Smartest City](https://thehague.com/businessagency/the-hague-the-winner-world-smart-city-award-2021), and which wants to remain a global centre of excellence of peace, justice, and sustainability in the era of big data and AI.
